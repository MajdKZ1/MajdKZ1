# Majd AlZadjali  
### Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Engineer 🔐💻

I like building things that actually matter — systems that stay fast, secure, reliable, and useful in the real world. I’m obsessed with clean architecture, strong security foundations, and engineering solutions that remove friction instead of adding more of it.

Most of what I build focuses on making technology simpler, safer, and more accessible. Whether it’s infrastructure, automation tools, or security systems, my goal is always the same: create something that works, is easy to maintain, and genuinely helps people.

I enjoy designing networks, securing environments end-to-end, writing lightweight tooling, and improving systems until they feel effortless. Engineering, to me, is about clarity and impact — no noise, no unnecessary complexity ⚡️.

I’m also open to working and collaborating on projects — whether open-source or proprietary. If something sparks my interest, I’m always willing to contribute, build, or help push it further.
